<h3><span>VENERABLE BEDE'S MENTAL ALMANAC.</span></h3>

<p>If our own ancient British sage, the Venerable Bede, could rise up from
the dust of eleven centuries, he might find us, notwithstanding all our
astounding improvements, in a worse position, in one respect at least,
than when he left us; and as the subject would be one in which he was
well versed, it would indubitably attract his attention.</p>

<p>He might then set about teaching us from his own writings a mental
resource, far superior to any similar device practised by ourselves, by
which the day of the week belonging to any day of the month, in any year
of the Christian era, might easily and speedily be found.</p>

<p>And when the few, who would give themselves the trouble of thoroughly
understanding it, came to perceive its easiness of acquirement, its
simplicity in practice, and its firm hold upon the memory, they might
well marvel how so admirable a facility should have been so entirely
forgotten, or by what perversion of judgment it could have been
superseded by the comparatively clumsy and impracticable method of the
Dominical letters.</p>

<p>Let us hear his description of it in his own words:</p>


<p>"Q<span class="smcap lowercase">UÆ SIT FERIA IN</span> C<span class="smcap lowercase">ALENDIS</span>.</p>


 <p class="blockquot">"Simile autem huic tradunt argumentum ad inveniendam diem
   Calendarum promptissimum.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"Habet ergo regulares Januarius <span class="smcap lowercase">II</span>, Februarius <span class="smcap lowercase">V</span>, Martius <span class="smcap lowercase">V</span>,
   Apriles <span class="smcap lowercase">I</span>, Maius <span class="smcap lowercase">III</span>, Junius <span class="smcap lowercase">VI</span>, Julius <span class="smcap lowercase">I</span>, Augustus <span class="smcap lowercase">IIII</span>,
   September <span class="smcap lowercase">VII</span>, October <span class="smcap lowercase">II</span>, November <span class="smcap lowercase">V</span>, December <span class="smcap lowercase">VII</span>. Qui
   videlicet regulares hoc specialiter indicant, quota sit feria per
   Calendas, eo anno quo septem concurrentes adscripti sunt dies:
   cæteris vero annis addes concurrentes quotquot in præsenti
   fuerunt adnotati ad regulares mensium singulorum, et ita diem
   calendarum sine errore semper invenies. Hoc tantum memor esto, ut
   cum imminente anno bisextili unus concurrentium intermittendus
   est dies, eo tamen numero quem intermissurus es in Januario
   Februarioque utaris: ac in calendis primum Martiis per illum qui
   circulo centinetur solis computare incipias. Cum ergo diem
   calendarum, verbi gratia, Januarium, quærere vis; dicis Januarius
   II, adde concurrentes septimanæ dies qui fuerunt anno quo
   computas, utpote III, fiunt quinque; quinta feria intrant calendæ
   Januariæ. Item anno qui sex habet concurrentes, sume v regulares
   mensis Martii, adde concurrentes sex, fiunt undecim, tolle
   septem, remanent quatuor, quarta feria sunt Calendæ
   Martiæ."&mdash;Bedæ Venerabilis, <i>De Temporum Ratione</i>, caput xxi.</p>

<p>The meaning of this may be expressed as follows:&mdash;Attached to the twelve
months of the year are certain fixed numbers called regulars, ranging
from <span class="smcap lowercase">I</span> to <span class="smcap lowercase">VII</span>, denoting the days of the week in their usual order. These
regulars, in any year whereof the concurrent, or solar epact, is 0 or 7,
express, of themselves, the commencing day of each month: but in other
years, whatever the solar epact of the year may be, that epact must
be<a id="be202"></a>
 <span  class="pagenum">[202]</span> added
 to the regular of any month to indicate, in a similar
manner, the commencing day of that month.</p>

<p>It follows, therefore, that the only burthen the memory need be charged
with is the distribution of the regulars among the several months;
because the other element, the solar epact (which also ranges from 1 to
7), may either be obtained from a short mental calculation, or, should
the system come into general use, it would soon become a matter of
public notoriety during the continuance of each current year.</p>

<p>Now, these solar epacts have several practical advantages over the
Dominical letters. 1. They are numerical in themselves, and therefore
they are found at once, and used directly, without the complication of
converting figures into letters and letters into figures. 2. They
increase progressively in every year; whereas the Dominical letters have
a crab-like retrogressive progress, which impedes facility of practice.
3. The <i>rationale</i> of the solar epacts is more easily explained and more
readily understood: they are the accumulated odd days short of a
complete week; consequently the accumulation must increase by 1 in every
year, except in leap years, when it increases by 2; because in leap
years there are 2 odd days over 52 complete weeks. But this irregularity
in the epact of leap year does not come into operation until the
additional day has actually been added to the year; that is, not until
after the 29th of February. Or, as Bede describes it, "<i>in leap years
one of the concurrent days is intermitted, but the number so intermitted
must be used for January and February; after which, the epact obtained
from cyclical tables</i> (or from calculation) <i>must be used for the
remaining months</i>." By which he means, that the epacts increase in
arithmetical succession, except in leap years, when the series is
interrupted by one number being passed over; the number so passed over
being used for January and February only. Thus, 2 being the epact of
1851, 3 would be its natural successor for 1852; but, in consequence of
this latter being leap year, 3 is intermitted (except for January and
February), and 4 becomes the real epact, as obtained from calculation.</p>

<p>To calculate the solar epact for any year, Bede in another place gives
the following rule:</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "Si vis scire concurrentes septimanæ dies, sume annos Domini et
   eorum quartum partem adjice: his quoque quatuor adde, (quia)
   quinque concurrentes fuerunt anno Nativitatis Domini: hos partire
   per septem et remanent Epactæ Solis."</p>

<p>That is: take the given year, add to it its fourth part, and also the
constant number 4 (which was the epact preceding the first year of the
Christian era), divide the sum by 7, and what remains is the solar
epact. (If there be no remainder, the epact may be called either 0 or
7.)</p>

<p>This is an excellent rule; the same, I believe, that is to this day
prescribed for arriving at the Dominical letter of the Old Style. Let it
be applied, for example, to find upon what day of the week the battle of
Agincourt was fought (Oct. 25, 1415). Here we have 1415, and its fourth
353, and the constant 4, which together make 1772, divided by 7 leaves 1
as the solar epact; and this, added to 2, the <i>regular</i> for the month of
October, informs us that 3, or Tuesday, was the first day of that month;
consequently it was the 22nd, and Friday, the 25th, was Saint Crispin's
day.</p>

<p>But this rule of Bede's, in consequence of the addition, since his time,
of a thousand years to the number to be operated upon, is no longer so
convenient as a <i>mental</i> resource.</p>

<p>It may be greatly simplified by separating the centuries from the odd
years, by which the operation is reduced to two places of figures
instead of four. Such a method, moreover, has the very great advantage
of assimilating the operation of finding the solar epact, in both
styles, the Old and the New; the only remaining difference between them
being in the rules for finding the <i>constant number</i> to be added in each
century. These rules are as follow:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>For the Old Style.</i>&mdash;In any date, divide the number of centuries by 7,
and deduct the remainder from 4 (or 11); the result is the constant for
that century.</p>

<p><i>For the New Style.</i>&mdash;In any date, divide the number of centuries by 4,
double the remainder, and deduct it from 6: the result is the constant
for that century.</p>

<p><i>For the Solar Epact, in either Style.</i>&mdash;To the odd years of any date
(rejecting the centuries) add their fourth part, and also the constant
number found by the preceding rules; divide the sum by 7, and what
remains is the solar epact.</p>

<p>As an example of these rules in <i>Old Style</i>, let the former example be
repeated, viz. <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1415:</p>

<p>First, since the centuries (14), divided by 7, leave no remainder, 4 is
the constant number. Therefore 15, and 3 (the fourth), and 4 (the
constant), amount to 22, from which eliminating the sevens, remains 1 as
the solar epact.</p>

<p>For an example in <i>New Style</i>, let the present year be taken. In the
first place, 18 divided by 4 leaves 2, which doubled is 4, deducted from
6 results 2, the constant number for the present century. Therefore 51,
and 12 (the fourth), and 2 (the constant), together make 65, from which
the sevens being eliminated, remains 2, the solar epact for this year.</p>

<p>But in appreciating the practical facility of this method, we must bear
in mind that <i>the constant</i>, when once ascertained for any century,
remains unchanged throughout the whole of that century; and that <i>the
solar epact</i>, when once ascertained for any year, can scarcely require
recalculation during the remainder of that year: furthermore, that<a id="that203"></a>
 <span  class="pagenum">[203]</span>
although the rule for calculating the epact, as just recited, is so
extremely simple, yet even that slight mental exertion may be spared to
the mass of those who might benefit by its application to current
purposes; because it might become an object of general notoriety in each
current year. And I am not without hope that "N<span class="smcap lowercase">OTES AND</span> Q<span class="smcap lowercase">UERIES</span>" will
next year set the example to other publications, by making the current
solar epact for 1852 a portion of its "heading," and by suffering it to
remain, incorporated with the date of each impression, throughout the
year.</p>

<p>Let us now recur to the allotment of <i>the regulars</i> at the beginning of
Bede's description. Placed in succession their order is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="Bede regulars">

<tr>
<td></td>
<td class="tdleft"> April and July</td>
<td class="tdright"><span class="smcap lowercase">I</span>,</td>
<td class="tdleft"> or Sunday</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td></td>
<td class="tdleft"> January and October </td>
<td class="tdright"> <span class="smcap lowercase">II</span>,</td>
<td class="tdleft"> or Monday</td>

<p>There is no great difficulty in retaining this in the memory; but should
uncertainty arise at any time, it may be immediately corrected by a
mental reference to the following lines, the alliterative jingle of
which is designed to house them as securely in the brain as the immortal
and never-failing, "Thirty days hath September." The order of the
allotment is preserved by appropriating as nearly as possible a line to
each day of the week; while the absolute connexion here and there of
certain days, by name, with certain months, forms a sort of interweaving
that renders mistake or misplacement almost impossible.</p>

     <p> "April loveth to link with July,</p>
     <p> And the merry new year with October comes by,</p>
     <p> August for Wednesday, Tuesday for May,</p>
      <p>March and November and Valentine's Day,</p>
     <p> Friday is June day, and lastly we seek</p>
      <p>September and Christmas to finish the week."</p>

</div>

<p>Now, since we have ascertained, from the short calculation before
recited, that the solar epact of this present year of 1851 is 2, and
since the regular of October is also 2, we have but to add them together
to obtain 4 (or Wednesday) as the commencing day of this next coming
month of October. And, if we wish to know the day of the month belonging
to any other day of the week in October, we have but to subtract the
commencing day, which is 4, from 8, and to the result add the required
day. Let the latter, for example, be Sunday; then 4 from 8 leaves 4,
which added to 1 (or Sunday), shows that Sunday, in the month of October
1851, is either 5th, 12th, 19th, or 26th.</p>

<p>This additional application is here introduced merely to illustrate the

<h3><span>HYPHENISM, HYPHENIC, HYPHENIZATION.</span></h3>

<p>Where our ancestors wanted words, they made them, or imported them
ready made. But we are become so particular about the etymological
force of newly coined words, that we can never please ourselves, but
rather choose to do without than to tolerate anything exceptionable. We
have to learn again that a word cannot be like Burleigh's nod, but must
be content to indicate the whole by the expression of some prominent
part, or of some convenient part, prominent or not.</p>

<p>Among the uses to which the "N<span class="smcap lowercase">OTES AND</span> Q<span class="smcap lowercase">UERIES</span>" might be put, is the
suggestion of words. It very often happens that one who is apt at
finding the want is not equally good for the remedy, and <i>vice versâ</i>.
By the aid of this journal the blade might find a handle, or the handle
a blade, as wanted, with the advantage of criticism at the formation;
while an author who coins a word, must commit himself before he can have
much advice.</p>

<p>The above remarks were immediately suggested by my happening to think of
a word for a thing which gives much trouble, and requires more attention
than it has received, but not more than it may receive if it can be
fitly designated by a single word. A <i>clause</i> of a sentence, both by
etymology and usage, means any part of it of which the component words
cannot be separated, but must all go together, or all remain together:
it is then a component of the sentence which has a finished meaning in
itself. The proper mode of indicating the clauses takes its name from
the means, and not from the end: we say <i>punctuation</i>, not
<i>clausification</i>. This may have been a misfortune, for it is possible
that punctuation might have been better studied, if its name had
imported its object. But there is another and a greater misfortune,
arising from the total want of a name. In a sentence, not only do
collections of words form minor sentences, but they also form compound
words: sometimes eight or ten words are really only one. When two words
are thus compounded, we use a hyphen: but those who have attempted to
use more than one hyphen have been laughed out of the field; though
perspicuity, logic, and algebra were all on their side. The <i>Morning
Post</i> adopted this practice in former days; and Horace Smith (or James,
as the case may be,) ridiculed them in a parody which speaks of "the
not-a-bit-the-less-on-that-account-to-be-universally-detested monster
Buonaparte." It is, I think, much to be regretted that the use of the
hyphen is so restricted: for<a id="for204"></a>
 <span  class="pagenum">[204]</span>
 though, like the comma, it might be
abused, yet the abuse would rather tend to clearness.</p>

<p>But, without introducing a further use of the hyphen, it would be
desirable to have a distinct name for a combination of words; which,
without being such a recognised and permanent compound as <i>apple-tree</i>
or <i>man in the moon</i>, is nevertheless one word in the particular
sentence in hand. And the name is easily found. The word hyphen being
Greek (<span title="[Greek: hyph' hen]">&#8017;&#966;' &#7957;&#957;</span>), and
 being made a substantive, we might join
Greek suffixes to it, and speak of <i>hyphenisms</i> and <i>hyphenic</i> phrases.
For example, the following I should call a hyphenic error. When the
British Museum recently published <i>A Short Guide to that Portion of the
Library of printed Books now open to the Public</i>, a review pronounced
the title a misnomer; because the <i>books</i> are not open to the public,
but are in locked glass cases. The reviewer read it "library of
printed-books-now-open-to-the-public," instead of
"library-of-printed-books now open to the public." And though in this
case the reviewer was very palpably wrong, yet there are many cases in
which a real ambiguity exists.</p>

<p>A neglect of mental hyphenization often leads to mistake as to an
author's meaning, particularly in this age of morbid implication. For
instance, a person writes something about "a Sunday or other
day-for-which-there-is-a-special-service;" and is taken as meaning "a
Sunday-or-other-day for which," &amp;c. The odds are that some readers will
suppose him, by speaking of Sundays <i>with</i> special service, to imply that
some are <i>without</i>.</p>

<h3><span>GRAY AND COWLEY.</span></h3>

<p>Some spirited publisher would confer a serious obligation on the
classical world by bringing out an edition of Gray's <i>Poems</i>, with the
parallel passages annexed. "Taking him for all in all," he is one of our
most perfect poets: and though Collins might have rivalled him (under
circumstances equally auspicious), he could have been surpassed by
Milton alone. In 1786, Gilbert Wakefield attempted to do for Gray what
Newton and Warton had done for Milton (and, for one, I thank him for
it); but his illustrations, though almost all good and to the point, are
generally from books which every ordinary reader knows off by heart.
Besides, Wakefield is so very egotistical, and at times so very puerile,
that he is too much for most people. However, his volume, <i>The Poems of
Mr. Gray, with Notes</i>, by Gilbert Wakefield, B.A., late Fellow of Jesus
College, Cambridge: London, 1786, would furnish a good substratum for
the volume I am now recommending.</p>

<p>Not to speak of Milton's English poems and the great masterpieces of
ancient times, with which so learned a scholar as Gray was, of course,
familiar, he draws largely from the Greek anthology, from Nonnus, from
Milton's Latin poems, from Cowley, and I had almost said from the prose
works of Bishop Jeremy Taylor. His admiration of the great "Shakspeare
of Divinity" is proved from a portion of one of his letters to Mason;
and some other day I may furnish an illustration or two. Indeed, were
any publisher to undertake the generous office I mention, I dare say
that many a secret treasure would be unlocked, and many an "orient pearl
at random strung" be forthcoming for his use. Let me first mention
Gray's opinion of Cowley, and then add in confirmation one or two
passages out of many. He says in a note to his "Ode on the Progress of
Poesy:"</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "We have had in our language not other odes of the sublime kind
   than that of Dryden 'On St. Cecilia's Day:' for <i>Cowley (who had
   his merit) yet wanted judgment, style, and harmony for such a
   task</i>. That of Pope is not worthy of so great a man."</p>

<p>We must submit to Gray's oracular sentence, for he himself was
pre-eminently gifted in the three great qualities in which he declares
the deficiency of Cowley (at least if we are to judge from his English
poems; for the prosody of his Latin efforts seems sadly deficient). At
times Cowley's "harmony" is not first-rate, and his "style" is deeply
impregnated with the fantastic conceits of the day; but he is still a
poet, and a great one too. And I think that in some of his writings Gray
had Cowley evidently in mind; <i>e.g.</i> in the <i>epitaph</i> to his "Elegy in a
Country Churchyard:"</p>

<div class="poem">

  <p>"Large was his bounty, and his soul sincere,</p>

<p>I do not mean that Gray may not have had other poets in his mind when
writing these lines (for there is nothing new or uncommon about them);
but rather a careful going over of Cowley's poems convinces me that Gray
was sensible of his "merits," and often corrects his want of "judgment"
by his own refined and most exquisite taste. I must give one more
instance; and I think that Bishop Hall's allusion to his life at
Emmanuel College, and Bishop Ridley's "Farewell to Pembroke Hall," must
every one fall into the background before Cowley. Gray's poem ought to
be too well known to require quoting:</p>

    <p>  "Against Sir Hugh Montgomery,</p>

     <p> The grey goose wing that was thereon</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">says that "the thought" in that stanza "was never touched by any other
poet, and is such a one as would have shined in Homer or Virgil." It is
perhaps true that there is no passage in any other writer exactly
resembling this, but it is not quite true that the thought has not been
<i>touched</i>; for there is something approaching to it in Ovid's
<i>Metamorphoses</i>, where the slaughter of Niobe's children by the arrows
of Apollo is described:</p>

<div class="poem">

<p>The author of this ballad would appear, from the passages cited by

it.</p>

<p>&mdash;The following anecdote of Horace Walpole
while at Eton was related by the learned Jacob Bryant, one of his
school-fellows, and has not, I believe, been printed; it is at all
events very much at your service.</p>

<p>In those days the Etonians were in the habit of acting plays, and
amongst others <i>Tamerlane</i> was selected for representation. The cast of
parts has unluckily not been preserved, but it is sufficient for us to
know that the lower boys were put into requisition to personate the
mutes. After the performance the wine, which had been provided for the
actors, had disappeared, and a strong suspicion arose that the lower
boys behind the scenes had made free with it, and Horace Walpole
exclaimed, "The mutes have swallowed the liquids!"</p>

<h3><span>CONTINENTAL WATCHMEN AND THEIR SONGS.</span></h3>

<p>The inquiries I made in Vol. iii., p. 324., respecting the Bellman and
his Songs, have been answered by most interesting information (pp. 377.
451. 485.); and the references made by the Editor to V. Bourne's
translation was most acceptable. The interest of this subject is
increased by finding that the Custos Nocturnus exists at the present day
in other countries, resembling very much in duties, costume, and chants
the Westminster Bellman. I venture to send you extracts from W. Hurton's
<i>Voyage from Leith to Lapland</i>, and Dr. Forbes's <i>Physician's Holiday</i>.</p>

 <p class="blockquot">"During the past year of 1849 it has been my lot to reside at
   four of the most remarkable capitals of Europe, and successively
   to experience what spring is in London, what summer is in Paris,
   what autumn is in Edinburgh, and what winter is in Copenhagen.
   Vividly, indeed, can I dwell on the marvellous contrast of the
   night aspect of each: but one of the most interesting
   peculiarities I have noticed in any of them, is that presented by
   the watchmen of the last-named. When I first looked on these
   guardians of the night, I involuntarily thought of Shakspeare's
   Dogberry and Verges. The sturdy watchers are muffled in
   uniform<a id="great207"></a>
<span  class="pagenum">[207]</span>
 great coats, and also wear fur caps. In their hand
   they carry a staff of office, on which they screw, when occasion
   requires, that fearful weapon the 'morning star.' They also
   sometimes may be seen with a lanthorn at their belt: the candle
   contained in the lanthorn they place at the top of their staff,
   to relight any street-lamps which require trimming. In case of
   fire, the watchmen give signals from the church towers, by
   striking a number of strokes, varying with the quarter of the
   city in which the fire occurs; and they also put from the tower
   flags and lights pointed in the direction where the destructive
   element is raging. From eight o'clock in the evening, until four
   (Query, until five) o'clock in the morning, all the year round,
   they chant a fresh verse at the expiration of each hour, as they
   go their rounds. The cadence is generally deep and guttural, but
   with a peculiar emphasis and tone; and from a distance it floats
   on the still night air with a pleasing and impressive effect,
   especially to the ear of a stranger. The verses in question are
   of great antiquity, and were written, I am told, by one of the
   Danish bishops. They are printed on a large sheet of paper, with
   an emblematical border, rudely engraved in the old style; and in
   the centre is a large engraving exactly representing one of the
   ancient watchmen, in the now obsolete costume, with his staff and
   'morning star' in hand, a lanthorn at his belt, and his dog at
   his feet.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"A copy of the broadside has been procured me, and my friend Mr.
   Charles Beckwith has expressly made for me a verbatim translation
   of the verses; and his version I will now give at length. I am
   induced to do this, because, not only are the chants most
   interesting in themselves, as a fine old relic of Scandinavian
   customs, but there seems to me a powerful poetical spirit
   pervading them. At the top of the sheet are the lines which in
   the translation are&mdash;</p>

<p>Dr. Forbes writes:</p>

   <p class="blockquot">"We had very indifferent rest in our inn, owing to the over-zeal
   of the Chur watchmen, whose practice it is to perambulate the
   town through the whole night, twelve in number, and who on the
   present occasion displayed a most energetic state of vigilance.
   They not only called, but sung out, every hour, in the most
   sonorous strains, and even chanted a long string of verses on the
   striking of some.... I suppose the good people of Chur think
   nothing of these chantings, or from habit hear them not; but a
   tired traveller would rather run the risk of being robbed in
   tranquillity, than be thus sung from his propriety during all the
   watches of the night."&mdash;<i>A Physician's Holiday</i>, pp. 80, 81.</p>

<p>Dr. Forbes gives a copy of a "Watch Chant at Chur," with a translation,
pp. 81, 82. At p. 116. he says:</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "In our hotel at Altorf we were again saluted, during the vigils
   of the night, but in a very mitigated degree, with some of the
   same patriotic and pious strains which had so disturbed us at
   Chur. As chanted here, however, they were far from unwelcome. The
   only other place, I think, where we heard these Wächterrufe was
   Neufchatel. These calls are very interesting relics of the old
   times, and must be considered indicative as well of the simple
   habits of the old time, as of the pious feelings of the people of
   old."</p>

<p>He then gives the Evening and Morning Chants in the town of Glarus, and
the chant in use in some places in the canton of Zurich; but in Zurich
itself the chant is no longer heard.</p>

<p>Dr. Forbes concludes the twelfth chapter with the following observation:</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "The same antiquity, and also the inveteracy of old customs to
   persist, is strikingly shown by the fact that in some parts of
   the canton of Tessino, where the common language of the people is
   Italian, the night watch-call is still in old German."</p>

<p>The apparent universality of the Bellman throughout Europe gives rise to
questions that would, I apprehend, extend beyond the object of
 "N<span class="smcap lowercase">OTES AND</span> Q<span class="smcap lowercase">UERIES</span>;" such as, Is pure religion benefited by the engrafting of
it upon stocks so familiar as the bellman or watchman? What are the
causes that the old ecclesiastic bellman is no longer heard in some
countries, whilst in others he continues with little or no variation?
Has religion lost or gained by the change?</p>

<p>Dr. Forbes's notice of the Tessino watchman calls up the public crier in
England, another class of bellmen, asking for a hearing, with his "O
yes!<a id="yes208"></a>
<span  class="pagenum">[208]</span>
 O yes!" Little does he think that he is speaking French.</p>

<h3><span class="bla">Minor Queries.</span></h3>

<h4><span>151. <i>Quotation from Bacon.</i></span></h4>

<p>&mdash;In Lord Campbell's Life of Lord Bacon
(<i>Lives of the Lord Chancellors</i>, vol. ii. p. 314.) he gives an extract
from Lord Bacon's speech in the House of Commons, on his proposed bill
for "Suppressing Abuses in Weights and Measures." In the following
sentence there is a word which seems to require explanation:</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "The fault of using false weights and measures is grown so
   intolerable and common, that if you would build churches you
   shall not need for battlements and <i>halls</i>, other than false
   weights of lead and brass."</p>

<p>The use of lead for the battlements of churches seems obvious enough:
but what can <i>halls</i> mean, unless it be a misprint for <i>bells</i>, for
which brass would be required?</p>

<h4><span>152. <i>Carmagnoles.</i></span></h4>

<p>&mdash;Can any of your readers tell me the exact meaning
of the <i>Carmagnoles</i> of the French Revolution? Is the "Marseillaise" a
Carmagnole song? If the word be derived from Carmagnuola in Piedmont,
what is the story of its origin?</p>

<h4><span>153. <i>The Use of Tobacco by the Elizabethan Ladies.</i></span></h4>

<p>&mdash;In <i>An
Introduction to English Antiquities, by James Eccleston, B.A.</i>, 8vo.
1847, p. 306., the author, speaking of the ladies of the reign of
Elizabeth, has the following passage:</p>

<p class="blockquot">"It is with regret we add, that their teeth were at this time
   generally black and rotten, a defect which foreigners attributed
   to their inordinate love for sugar, but which may, perhaps, be
   quite as reasonably ascribed to their frequent habit of taking
   the Nicotian weed to excess."</p>

<p>Does the author mean to insinuate by the above, that the Elizabethan
ladies indulged in the "filthy weed" by "smoaking" or "chewing?" I have
always understood that the "Nicotian weed" <i>whitened</i> the teeth rather
than <i>blackened</i> them, but should be glad to be enlightened upon the
subject by some of your scientific readers.</p>

<h4><span>155. <i>Story referred to by Jeremy Taylor.</i></span></h4>

<p>&mdash;Jeremy Taylor (<i>Duct.

<p class="blockquot"> "The Greek that denied the depositum of his friend, and offered
   to swear at the altar that he had restored it already, did not
   preserve his conscience and his oath by desiring his friend to
   hold the staff in which he had secretly conveyed the money. It is
   true, he delivered it into his hand, desiring that he would hold
   it till he had sworn; but that artifice was a plain cozenage, and
   it was prettily discovered. For the injured person, in
   indignation at the perjury, smote the staff upon the ground, and
   broke it, and espied the money."</p>

210.) refers:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "It is a well-known fact that in the vast prairies of Texas a

 <p class="right">      "S<span class="smcap lowercase">ACRE</span> C<span class="smcap lowercase">HEVEUX</span>."</p>

<p>It does not seem to bear allusion to the crest, a griffin, nor to any of

remember. If you will enlighten me as to the meaning and origin of the
motto, I shall be obliged.</p>

<h4><span>159. "<i>Mad as a March Hare.</i>"</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;In Mr. Mayhew's very interesting work,

of hareskins, in giving an account of his calling, says:</p>

 <p class="blockquot">"Hareskins is in&mdash;leastways I c'lects them&mdash;from September to the
   end of March, when hares, they says, goes mad."</p>

<p>Perhaps the allusion to the well-known saying, "as mad as a March hare,"
on this occasion was made without the collector of hareskins being aware
of the existence of such a saying. Is anything known of its origin? I
imagine that Mr. Mayhew's work will bring many such sayings to light.</p>

<h4><span>160. <i>Vermin, Payments for Destruction of, and Ancient Names.</i></span></h4>

<p>&mdash;Can you
afford me any information as to the authority (act of parliament, or
otherwise,) by which churchwardens in old times paid sums of money for
the destruction of vermin in the several parishes in England; and by
what process of reasoning, animals now deemed innocuous were then
thought to merit so rigorous an extirpation?</p>

<p>In some old volumes of churchwardens' accounts to which I have access, I
find names which it is impossible to associate with any
description<a id="of209"></a>
<span  class="pagenum">[209]</span>
of vermin now known. Perhaps some of your
correspondents may be able to identify them: such as <i>glead</i>,
<i>ringteal</i>, <i>greas'head</i>, <i>baggar</i>. My own impression as to the latter
name was, that it was only another way of spelling badger; but as, in
the volume to which I refer, the word <i>bowson</i> occurs, which the
historian Dr. Whitaker pronounces to be identical with that species of
vermin, my surmise can scarcely be correct.</p>

of Matthew Paris. It is quoted at some length by Archbishop Parker
(<i>Antiquit. Eccles. Brit.</i>, ed. Hanov. 1605, p. 158.). It is also
referred to, apparently upon Parker's authority, by several divines of
the succeeding age; by one or more of whom (as well as by Watt) the MS.
is spoken of as deposited in the Royal Library at St. James's. The words
produced by Parker do not occur in Matthew Paris's <i>Major History</i>;
though the editor of the second edition of the larger work would appear
to have consulted the <i>Hist. Minor</i>, either in the <i>Biblioth. Reg.</i>, or
the Cottonian Library, or else in the Library of Corpus Coll.,
Cambridge. Can any one gratify my curiosity by saying whether this MS.

are the figures of ten of their children in processional form&mdash;first,
two daughters singly; the rest two and two, four of which have skulls in
their right hands, and a book in their left, probably to denote their
being deceased at the time the monument was erected. At the feet of one
of the youngest children is represented a very small figure of a child
lying in a shroud, the date 1627.</p>

     <p> "Patient anglers, standing all the day</p>

<p>The word <i>stickle</i> appears to me to be used here for a pool. Is it ever
so used now, or has that meaning become obsolete? I do not find it in
Richardson's <i>Dictionary</i>.</p>

<p>In the Lake District, in the Langdales, is Harrison's Stickle or Stickle
Tarn, which I think confirms my view of the meaning.</p>

"also applied to a carriage with low, heavy wheels, dragged heavily
along, as a brewer's <i>dray</i>."</p>

<h3><span>POPE AND FLATMAN.<br />
(Vol. iv., p. 132.)</span></h3>

<p>In the edition of Pope's <i>Works</i> published by Knapton, Lintot, and
others, 1753, 9 vols., I find<a id="find210"></a>
  <span  class="pagenum">[210]</span>
 the following note to the Ode
entitled "The Dying Christian to his Soul:"&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">"This Ode was written in imitation of the famous Sonnet of
   Hadrian to his departing Soul, but as much superior to his
   original in sense and sublimity as the Christian religion is to
   the pagan."</p>

<p>This is confirmed by the correspondence of Pope with Steele, vol. vii.
pp. 185, 188, 189, 190. Letters 4, 7, 8, and 9.</p>

<p>That Pope also derived some hints at least from Flatman's Ode is, I
think, certain, from the following extract from a bookseller's catalogue
of a few years' date:</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "Flatman, Thos., Poems and Songs. Portrait slightly damaged.
   8vo., new, cf. gt. back, 8s. With autograph of Alex. Pope.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"MS. Note at p. 55.&mdash;'This next piece, <i>A Thought on Death</i>, is
   remarkable as being the verses from which Pope borrowed some of
   the thoughts in his Ode of The Dying Christian to his Soul.'"</p>

 <p class="right">   F. B. R<span class="smcap lowercase">ELTON</span>.</p>


<p>The question whether Flatman borrowed from Pope or Pope from Flatman
(the former seems far more probable) may perhaps be decided by the date
of Flatman's composition, if that can be ascertained. Pope's ode was
composed in November, 1712, as recorded in the interesting series of
letters in the correspondence between Pope and Steele (<i>Letters</i> iv. to
ix.) and in the 532nd number of the <i>Spectator</i>. From Steele's letter it
appears that the stanzas were composed for music: is any setting of them
known, anterior to that by Harwood, which has obtained such universal
popularity, in spite of its many undeniable errors in harmony? Is
anything known of this composer? he certainly was not deficient either
in invention or taste, and must have written other pieces worthy to be
remembered.</p>

 <p class="right">  E. V.</p>

<p>It seems probable that the coincidence between the passages of Thomas
Flatman and Pope, indicated at p. 132., arises from both imitating the
<i>alliteration</i> of the original:</p>

   <div class="poem">

<p>  "<i>Animula, vagula, blandula,</i></p>
      <p>Hospes, comesque corporis,</p>
      <p>Quæ nunc abibis in loca,</p>

<h3><span>TEST OF STRENGTH OF A BOW.<br />
(Vol. iv., p. 56.)</span></h3>

<p>Although unable to answer all the Queries of T<span class="smcap lowercase">OXOPHILUS</span>, the subjoined
information may possibly advantage him. His Queries of course have
reference to the long bow, and not to the arbalest, or cross-bow. The
length of this bow appears to have varied according to the height and
strength of the bowman; for in the 12th year of the reign of Edward IV.
an act was passed ordaining that every Englishman should be possessed of
a bow of his own height. Bishop Latimer also, in one of his sermons,
preached before Edward VI., and published in 1549, wherein he enforces
the practice of archery, has the following passage:</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "In my time my father taught me how to draw, how to lay my body
   in my bow, and not to draw with strength of arms, as other
   nations do, but with strength of body. I had my bows brought me
   according to my age and strength: as I increased in them, so my
   bows were made bigger and bigger."</p>

<p>The length of the full-sized bow appears to have been about six feet:
the arrow, three.</p>

<p>The distance to which an arrow could be shot from the long bow of course
depended, in a great measure, upon the quality and toughness of the
wood, as well as upon the skill and strength of the archer; but I
believe it will be found that the tougher and more unyielding the bow,
the greater the strength required in bending it, and consequently the
greater the force imparted to the arrow. The general distance to which
an arrow could be shot from the long bow seems to have been from eleven
to twelve score yards; although there are instances on record of
individuals shooting from 400 to 500 yards.</p>

<p>The best bows used by our ancestors were made of yew, as it appears from
a statute made in the thirty-third year of the reign of Henry VIII., by
which it was enacted&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "That none under the age of seventeen should shoot with a bow of
   yew, except his parents were worth 10<i>l.</i> per annum in lands, or
   40 marks in goods: and for every bow made of yew, the bowyer not
   inhabiting London or the suburbs should make four, and the
   inhabitant there two, bows of other wood."</p>

<p>These restrictions were doubtless owing to the great scarcity of yew.
The other woods most in request were elm, witch-hazel, and ash. By the
statute 8th of Elizabeth, cap 3., it was ordained that every bowyer
residing in London should have always ready fifty bows of either of the
before-mentioned woods. By this statute also the prices at which the
bows were to be sold were regulated.</p>

<p>I believe the ancient bows were made of one piece; whether there is any
advantage to be derived in having a bow of more than two pieces, I leave
for some one better qualified than myself to determine.</p>

<p>As regards arrows, Ascham, in his <i>Toxophilus</i>, has enumerated fifteen
sorts of wood of which arrows were made in his time, viz. brasell,
turkie-wood, fusticke, sugercheste, hard-beam, byrche, ash, oak,
service-tree, alder, blackthorn, elder,<a id="elder211"></a>
  <span  class="pagenum">[211]</span>
 beach, aspe, and sallow;
of these aspe and ash were accounted the best; the one for
target-shooting, the other for war. The author of <i>The Field Book</i> says:</p>

<p class="blockquot">"That an arrow weighing from twenty to four-and-twenty
   pennyweights, made of yew, was considered by archers the best
   that could be used."</p>

 <p class="right">   D<span class="smcap lowercase">AVID</span> S<span class="smcap lowercase">TEVENS</span>.</p>

 <p class="left">   Godalming.</p>

<p>The method of trying and proving a bow is stated by Ascham to be thus:</p>

<p class="blockquot">"By shooting it in the fields, and <i>sinking</i> it with <i>dead heavy</i>
   shafts; looking where it <i>comes</i> most, and providing for that
   place betimes, lest it pinch and so fret. When the bow has thus
   been shot in, and appears to contain good shooting wood, it must
   be taken to a skilful workman, to be cut shorter, scraped, and
   dressed fitter, and made to come circularly round; and it should
   be whipped at the ends, lest it snap in sunder or fret sooner
   than the archer is aware of."</p>

<p>It is calculated that an arrow may be shot 110 yards for every 20 lbs.
weight of the bow.</p>

<p>As regards the length of the old English bow, the statute 5th of Edward
IV. cap. 4., runs thus:</p>

<p class="blockquot">  "That every Englishman, and Irishmen that dwell with Englishmen
   and speak English, that be between sixteen and sixty in age,
   shall have an English bow of his own length."</p>

<p>Ascham recommended for men of average strength arrows made of birch,
hornbeam, oak, and ash.</p>

<h3><span>BASKERVILLE THE PRINTER.<br />
(Vol. iv., pp. 40. 123.)</span></h3>

<p>Hansard's <i>Typographia</i>, i. 8vo. 1825, Preface, p. xii&mdash;xiii.:</p>

  <p class="blockquot">"Of the more modern portraits something remains to be said, and
   particularly of that of Baskerville. It has been hitherto
   supposed that no likeness is extant of this first promoter of
   fine printing, and author of various improvements in the
   Typographic Art, as well as in the arts connected with it. At the
   time when I was collecting information for that part of my work
   in which Mr. Baskerville is particularly mentioned (p. 310. <i>et
   seq.</i>), I thought it a good opportunity to make inquiry at
   Birmingham whether any portrait or likeness of him remained; for
   a long time the inquiry was constantly answered in the negative,
   but at last it occurred to a friend to make a search among the
   family of the late Mrs. Baskerville, and he was successful. Mr.
   Baskerville married the widow of a Mr. Eaves; her maiden name was
   Ruston; she had two children by her former husband, a son and a
   daughter: the latter married her first cousin, Mr. Josiah Ruston,
   formerly a respectable druggist at Birmingham, and she survived
   her husband. At the sale of some effects after her decease,
   portraits of her mother and her father-in-law, Mr. Baskerville,
   were purchased by Mr. Knott of Birmingham. Some of Mr. Ruston's
   family and friends who are still living, consider this likeness
   of Mr. Baskerville as a most excellent and faithful resemblance.
   It was taken by one Miller, an artist of considerable eminence in
   the latter part of Baskerville's time. The inquiries of my friend
   Mr. Grafton, of Park Grove, near Birmingham, at once brought this
   painting into notice: and at his solicitation Mr. Knott kindly
   permitted Mr. Raven of Birmingham, an artist of much celebrity,
   to copy it for my use and the embellishment of this work; to
   which, I think, the united talents of Mr. Craig and Mr. Lee have
   done ample justice."</p>

<p>The portrait faces p. 310. of Mr. Hansard's book, and there may be found
an account, though somewhat different, of the exhumation alluded to by

<h4><span><i>Mazer Wood and Sin-eaters</i></span> <span>(Vol. iii., pp. 239. 288.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;The following
extract from Hone's <i>Year Book</i>, p. 858., will add to the explanation
furnished by S. S. S., and will also give an instance of the singular
practices which prevailed among our ancestors:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">"Among the Lansdowne MSS. in the British Museum are statements in
   Aubrey's own handwriting to this purport. In the county of
   Hereford, was an old custom at funerals, to hire poor people, who
   were to take upon them the sins of the party deceased. One of
   them (he was a long, lean, ugly, lamentable, poor rascal), I
   remember, lived in a cottage on Rosse highway. The manner was,
   that when the corpse was brought out of the house, and laid on
   the bier, a loaf of bread was brought out, and delivered to the
   sin eater, over the corpse, as also a <i>mazard bowl</i> of maple,
   full of beer (which he was to drink up), and sixpence in money,
   in consideration whereof he took upon him, <i>ipso facto</i>, all the
   sins of the defunct, and freed him or her from walking after they
   were dead."</p>

<p>Perhaps some of your readers may be able to throw some light on this
curious practice of <i>sin-eating</i>, or on the existence of regular
<i>sin-eaters</i>.</p>

  <p class="right">  E. H. B.</p>

   <p class="left">  Demerary.</p>

<p class="blockquot"> [Mr. Ellis, in his edition of Brande's <i>Popular Antiquities</i>,
   vol. ii. p. 155. 4to. has given a curious passage from the
   Lansdowne MSS. concerning a sin-eater who lived in Herefordshire,
   which has been quoted in the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>, vol. xcii.

<h4><span>"<i>A Posie of other Men's Flowers</i>"</span> <span>(Vol. iv., pp. 58. 125.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;If D. Q.
should succeed in finding<a id="finding212"></a>
 <span  class="pagenum">[212]</span>
 this saying in Montaigne's Works, I
hope he will be kind enough to send an "Eureka!" to "N<span class="smcap lowercase">OTES AND</span> Q<span class="smcap lowercase">UERIES</span>,"
as by referring to pp. 278. 451. of your second volume he will see that
I am interested in the question.</p>

<p>I am still inclined to think that the metaphor, <i>in its present concise
form</i> at all events, does <i>not</i> belong to Montaigne, though it may owe
its origin to some passage in the <i>Essays</i>. See, for example, one in
book i. chap. 24.; another in book ii. chap. 10., in Hazlitt's second
edition, 1845, pp. 54. 186.</p>

<p>But I have not forgotten Montaigne's motto, "Que sçais-je?" The chances
are that I am wrong. I should certainly like to see his right to the
saying satisfactorily proved by reference to book, chapter, and page.</p>

<h4><span><i>Simnels</i></span> <span>(Vol. iii., pp. 390. 506.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;T. very sensibly suggests that
Lambert <i>Simnel</i> is a nickname derived from a kind of cake still common
in the north of England, and eaten in Lent. I have never met with
<i>Simnel</i> as a surname, and have actually been told, as a child, that the
Simnels were called after Lambert; which is so far worthy of note as
that it connects the two together in tradition, though, no doubt, as T.
suggests, it is Lambert who was called after the Simnels. As a child I
took the liberty to infer, in consequence, that Parkins (gingerbread of
oatmeal instead of flour, and also common in the north of England) were
called after Perkin Warbeck. I am aware of the superior claim of
Peterkin now; but the coincidence may perhaps amuse your correspondents.</p>

<h4><span><i>A Ship's Berth</i></span> <span>(Vol. iv., p. 83.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;I would suggest to your
correspondents S. S. S. (2) another derivation for our word <i>berth</i>.</p>

<p>The present French <i>berceau</i>, a cradle, was in the Norman age written
<i>ber&#541;</i>, as appears in a MSS. <i>Life of St. Nicholas</i> in
the Bodleian Library. This Life has been printed at Bonn by Dr. Nicolaus
Delius, 1850; but in the print the character &#541; has been
represented by the ordinary z. This is a pity, because, as all know who
are familiar with our MSS. of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, this
figure &#541; took not unfrequently the place of &eth; (th); and
 on this account it is a character which ought to be
scrupulously preserved in editing. <i>Ber&#541;</i> then was
probably pronounced <i>berth</i>, or possibly with a little more of the
sibilant than is now found in the latter. How easily the <i>sibilant</i> and
the <i>th</i> run into one another may be seen by the third person singular
of our present Indicative:</p>

<h4><span><i>Suicides buried in Cross-roads</i></span> <span>(Vol. iv., p. 116.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;P. M. M. makes
inquiry respecting a practice formerly observed of <i>burying murderers in
cross-roads</i>. I have often heard that <i>suicides</i> were formerly interred
in such places, and that a stake used to be driven through the body. I
know of two places in the neighbourhood of <i>Boston</i> in Lincolnshire,
where such burials are stated to have taken place. One of these is about
a mile and a half south of Boston, on what is called the <i>low</i> road to
Freiston; a very ancient <i>hawthorn tree</i> marks the spot, and the tree
itself is said to have sprung from the stake which was driven through
the body of the self-murderer. The tradition was told me sixty years
since, and the interment was <i>then</i> said to have occurred <i>a hundred
years ago</i>; the suicide's name was at that time traditionally
remembered, and was told to me, but I cannot recall it. The tree
exhibits marks of great age, and is preserved with care; it still bears
"may," as the flower of the whitethorn is called, and <i>haws</i> in their
season.</p>

<p>The second grave (as it is reported) of this kind is on the high road
from Boston to Wainfleet, at the intersection of a road leading to
Butterwick, at a place called <i>Spittal Hill</i>; near the site of the
ancient hospital or infirmary, which was attached to the Priory of St.
James at Freiston. This spot is famous in the traditions of the
neighbourhood as the scene of the appearance of a sprite or hobgoblin,
called the "<i>Spittal Hill</i> T<span class="smcap lowercase">UT</span>;" which takes, in the language of the
district, the shape of a <span class="smcap lowercase">SHAG</span> <i>foal</i>, and is said to be connected with
the history of the suicide buried there.<a id="there213"></a>
 <span  class="pagenum">[213]</span></p>

<p>T<span class="smcap lowercase">UT</span> is a very general term applied in Lincolnshire to any fancied
supernatural appearance. Children are frightened by being told of <i>Tom
Tut</i>; and persons in a state of panic, or unreasonable trepidation, are
said to be <i>Tut-gotten</i>.</p>

<h4><span><i>A Sword-blade Note</i></span> <span>(Vol. iv., p. 176.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;The sword-blade note, to
which R. J. refers, was doubtless a note of the Sword-blade Company,
which was intimately connected with the South Sea Company. In the
narrative respecting the latter company, given in <i>The Historical
Register</i> for 1720, is an account of a conference between the South Sea
Directors and those of the Bank of England: therein is the following
passage:</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "And when it was urg'd that the <i>Sword Blade</i> Company should come
   into the Treaty; <i>By no means</i>, reply'd <i>Sir Gilbert</i>
   [Heathcote]; <i>for if the</i> South Sea <i>Company be wedded to the
   Bank, he ought not to be allow'd to keep a Mistress</i>. The Event
   show'd that the Bank acted with their usual Prudence, in not
   admitting the <i>Sword Blade</i> Company into a
   Partnership."&mdash;<i>Historical Register</i> for 1720, p. 368.</p>

<p>At p. 377. of the same work it is stated, that on the 24th of September
the Sword-blade Company, "who hitherto had been the chief cash keepers
to the South Sea Company," stopped payment, "being almost drain'd of
their ready money."</p>

<p>Perhaps some of your correspondents may be able to elucidate the rise,
transactions, and "winding up" of the Sword-blade Company.</p>

remarks on this letter, he will see that I did not state that <i>Tiverton</i>

<i>Twiverton</i>; Devonshire was inadvertently written for Somersetshire.
With regard to the observations of A. N. (p. 162.), he will find those
remarks were confined to the <i>v</i> between two vowels, <i>i.e.</i> without any
other consonant intervening; and, therefore, other forms of contraction
did not fall within the scope of them. I refrained from adverting to any
such words as Elvedon and Kelvedon (pronounced respectively Eldon and
Keldon), because the abbreviation of these may be referable to another
cause. In passing I would mention that I think there can be no
reasonable doubt that the word <i>dool</i>, about which he inquires, is no
other than the Ang.-Sax. <i>d&#257;l</i>, a division, from <i>daelan</i>, to divide;
and whence our words <i>deal</i> and <i>dole</i>. But to return to the letter <i>v</i>,
if M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. S<span class="smcap lowercase">INGER</span> be correct as to <i>devenisch</i> in the MS. of the <i>Hermit of
Hampole</i> being written for Danish (p. 159.), it seems an example of the
peculiar use of this letter to which I have invited attention, for the
writer hardly intended it to be pronounced as three syllables if he
meant Danish. However, if that MS. be a transcript, may not the supposed
<i>v</i> have been originally an <i>n</i>, which was first mis-read <i>u</i>, and then
copied as a <i>v</i>?</p>

<h4><span><i>"Nao" or "Naw," a Ship</i></span> <span>(Vol. iv., p. 28.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;I have already answered
G<span class="smcap lowercase">OMER</span> upon the imaginary word <i>naw</i>, a ship: I beg now to remark on
 M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. F<span class="smcap lowercase">ENTON'S</span> <i>nav</i>.
 If <i>nav</i> was a ship at all, I am at a loss to know why
it should be "a much older term." It would probably be subsequent to the
introduction of the Latin noun, which it docks of its final <i>is</i>. The
word or name is quoted from a Triad, the ninety-seventh of that series
which contains the mention of Llewelyn ap Griffith, the last prince of
Wales; and what makes it "one of the oldest" Triads, I have no idea. Nor
do I know what ascertains the date of any of them; or removes the date
of the composition of any one of them beyond the middle ages.</p>

<p>But <i>Nevydd</i> is no very uncommon proper name of men and women, derived
from <i>nev</i>, heaven; and <i>nav neivion</i> is simply "lord of lords." It
forms the plural like <i>mab</i>, <i>meibion</i>, and <i>march</i>, <i>meirchion</i>. Mr.
Walters gives <i>nav</i> under no words but <i>lord</i>. David ap Gwelyn either
mentions the navigation of the lords, the Trojan chieftains, to Britain;
or else that of Nevydd Nav Neivion, cutting short his title. But the
former is the plain sense of the thing. If M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. F<span class="smcap lowercase">ENTON</span> will only turn to
Owen's <i>Dictionary</i> (from which <i>naw</i>, a ship, is very properly
excluded) he will there find the quotation from Gwalchmai; in which the
three Persons of the Trinity are styled the <i>Undonion Neivion</i>,
"harmonizing or consentaneous Lords." He will scarcely make bold to turn
them into ships.</p>

<h4><span><i>Unde derivatur Stonehenge</i></span> <span>(Vol. iv., p. 57.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;Your correspondent P.
P. proposes to interpret this word, <i>horse-stones</i>, from <i>hengst</i>, the
Saxon for a horse; and to understand thereby large stones, as the words
<i>horse-chesnut</i>, <i>horse-daisy</i>, <i>horse-mushroom</i>, &amp;c., mean large ones.
But, if he had duly considered the arguments contained in Mr. Herbert's
<i>Cyclops Christianus</i>, pp. 162-4., he would have seen the necessity of
showing, that in Anglo-Saxon and English the description can follow, in
composition, the thing described; which it seems it can do in neither.
In support of his stone-horse, he should have produced a chesnut-horse
in the vegetable sense; a daisy-horse, or a mushroom-horse. Till he does
that, the grammatical canon appealed to by that author, will remain in
as full force against the stone-horse as against the stone-hanging.</p>

<h4><span><i>Nick Nack</i></span> <span>(Vol. iii., p. 179.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;A rude species of music very common
amongst the boys in Sheffield, called by them <i>nick-a-nacks</i>. It is made
by two pieces of bone, sometimes two pieces of wood, placed between the
fingers, and beaten in time by a rapid motion of the hand and fingers.
It is one of the periodical amusements of the boys going along the
streets.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"And with his right drew forth a truncheon of a white ox rib, and
   two pieces of wood of a like form; one of black Eben, and the
   other of incarnation Brazile; and put them betwixt the fingers of
   that hand, in good symmetry. Then knocking them together, made
   such a noise, as the lepers of Britany use to do with their
   clappering clickets; yet better resounding, and far more
   harmonious."&mdash;<i>Rabelais</i>, book ii. c. 19.</p>

<p class="right">     H. J.</p>



<h4><span><i>Meaning of Carfax</i></span> <span>(Vol. iii., p. 508.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;E. J. S. says "Carfoix
reminds me of Carfax in Oxford. Are the names akin to each other?" When
at Oxford I used to hear that Carfax was properly Quarfax, a contraction
for <i>quatuor facies</i>, four faces. The church, it will be remembered,
looks one way to High Street, another to Queen Street, a third to the
Cornmarket, and the fourth to St. Aldates's.</p>

<h4><span><i>Hand giving the Benediction</i></span> <span>(Vol. iii., p. 477.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;Rabbi Bechai tells
us of the solemn blessing in Numbers vi. 25, 26, 27., in which the name
Jehovah is thrice repeated, that, when the high priest pronounced it on
the people, "elevatione manuum <i>sic digitos composuit ut</i> TRIADA
<i>exprimerent</i>."</p>

<h4><span><i>Unlucky for Pregnant Women to take an Oath</i></span> <span>(Vol. iv., p. 151.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;I beg
to inform C<span class="smcap lowercase">OWGILL</span> that Irishwomen of the lower order almost invariably
refuse to be sworn while pregnant. Having frequently had to administer
oaths to heads of families applying for relief during the famine in
Ireland in 1847-8-9, I can speak with certainty as to the fact, though I
am unable to account for the origin of the superstition.</p>

<h4><span><i>Borough-English</i></span> <span>(Vol. iv., p. 133.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;<i>Burgh</i> or <i>Borough-English</i> is
a custom appendant to <i>ancient</i> boroughs, such as existed in the days of
Edward the Confessor and William the Conqueror, and are contained in the
Book of Domesday. Taylor, in his <i>History of Gavelkind</i>, p. 102.,
states, that in the villages round the city of Hereford, the lands are
all held in the tenure of Borough-English. There appears also to be a
customary<a id="customary215"></a>
 <span  class="pagenum">[215]</span>
descent of lands and tenements in some places called
<i>Borow-English</i>, as in Edmunton: vid. <i>Kitchin of Courts</i>, fol. 102. The
custom of <i>Borough-English</i>, like that of gavelkind, and those of London
and York, is still extant; and although it may have been in a great
measure superseded by <i>deed</i> or <i>will</i>, yet, doubtless, instances occur
in the present day of its vitality and consequent operation.</p>

<h4><span><i>Date of a Charter</i></span> <span>(Vol. iv., p. 152.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;I suspect that the charter to
which M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. H<span class="smcap lowercase">AND</span> refers, is one of the time of Henry II., and not of Henry
III. The latter sent no daughter to Sicily; but Joan, the daughter of
the former, was married to William, king of Sicily, in the year 1176, 22
Henry II. In the Great Roll of that year (Rot. 13 b.) are entries of
payments for hangings in the king's chamber on that occasion, and of
fifty marks given to Walter de Constantiis, Archdeacon of Oxford, for
entertaining the Sicilian ambassadors. See Madox's <i>Exchequer</i>, i. 367.,
who also in p. 18. refers to Hoveden, P. 2. p. 548. This may perhaps
assist in the discovery of the precise date, which I cannot at present
fix.</p>

<h3><span>NOTES ON BOOKS, SALES, CATALOGUES, ETC.</span></h3>

<p><i>The Jansenists: their Rise, Persecutions by the Jesuits, and existing
Remnant; a Chapter in Church History</i>: by S. P. Tregelles, LL.D., is an
interesting little monograph, reprinted with additions from Dr. Kitto's
<i>Journal of Biblical Literature</i>, and enriched with portraits of
Jansenius, St. Cyran, and the Mère Angelique. The history of the
Jansenist Church lingering in separate existence at Utrecht affords a
new instance of Catholicity of doctrine apart from the Papal communion;
and as such cannot fail to have a peculiar interest for many of our
readers.</p>

<p>The long, brilliant, and important reign of Louis XIV. has had many
chroniclers. The <i>Mémoires</i> written by those who figured in its busy
scenes are almost innumerable; many, as may be supposed from the
character of the monarch and the laxity of the court, being little
calculated for general perusal. Mr. James therefore did good service
when he presented the reading world with his historical view of <i>The
Life and Times of Louis XIV.</i>, a work in which, while he has done full
justice to the talents and genius of the monarch, and the brilliancy of
the circle by which he was surrounded, he has not allowed that splendour
so to dazzle the eyes of the spectator as to blind him to the real
infamy and heartlessness with which it was surrounded. We are therefore
well pleased to see Mr. James's history reprinted as the two new volumes
of Bohn's <i>Standard Library</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. L. A. Lewis of 125. Fleet Street will sell on Friday next two
extraordinary Collections of Tracts on Trade, Coinage, Commerce, Banks,
Public Institutions, and Trade generally. The First, in 167 Vols., in
fol., 4to., and 8vo., commences with Milles' <i>Customer's Replie</i>, 1604.
The Second, in 20 Vols., collected upwards of a century since, commences
with H. Gilbert's <i>Discourse of a Discoverie for a New Passage to
Cataia</i>, 1576. Both series should be secured for a Public Library.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"Of all sermons I have ever seen, they are by far the best adapted to
such congregations as I have had to preach to; at any rate, in my
opinion. And as a further proof of their adaptation to the people's
wants (and indeed the best proof that could be given), I have been
requested by some of my parishioners to lend them sermons, which were
almost <i>verbatim et literatim</i> transcripts of yours. That you may judge
of the extent to which I have been indebted to you, I may mention that
out of about seventy sermons which I preached at W&mdash;&mdash;, five or six were
Paley's and fifteen or sixteen yours. For my own credit's sake, I must
add, that all the rest were entirely my own."&mdash;<i>Extracted from the
letter of a stranger to the Author.</i></p>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
